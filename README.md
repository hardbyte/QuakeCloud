QuakeCloud
==========


Data grabbed from geonet: #http://wfs-beta.geonet.org.nz/geoserver/geonet/ows?service=WFS&version=1.0.0&request=GetFeature&typeName=geonet:quake&outputFormat=csv&cql_filter=BBOX%28origin_geom,174,-41,175,-42%29+AND+origintime%3E=%272013-07-18%27+AND+magnitude%3E3
 
 
put the py file and the data csv file in the same folder. 

It would be really amazing if someone could show me how to add the map to the top layer....
